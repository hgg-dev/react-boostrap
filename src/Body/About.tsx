                Aussie businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy,
                but many SMEs don’t have access to the funding they need and the
                service they deserve. Until now.

                Judo Bank commissioned The SME Banking Insights Report in 2018.
                This is an independent survey that talked to 1,750 SME’s on
                their experience when it comes to borrowing money, which found
                there was an $90 billion funding gap. The Judo Bank team, with
                experience at the highest levels of some of the world’s largest
                banks, saw an opportunity to give Aussie businesses a fairer go.
